# Zero-Shot Voice Cloning

## Introduction

Zero-Shot Voice Cloning is a course project for the Generative Neural Network class, focusing on the domain of zero-shot voice cloning. This subfield of artificial intelligence aims to replicate an individual's voice from a brief audio sample without prior exposure to that specific voice. The technology has significant potential for applications such as personalized digital assistants and multilingual dubbing for media, enhancing the accessibility and versatility of voice cloning technologies.

This project seeks to explore and improve the efficacy of voice cloning models, with a particular emphasis on using short audio samples. Our journey began with establishing a baseline method using the VITS model. Our objectives included augmenting the cloning efficiency of the FreeVC model and exploring the development of a hybrid model that combines the strengths of both the VITS and OpenVoice systems. Despite encountering significant challenges in developing the hybrid model, the process provided invaluable insights into the complexities of voice cloning technology.

## Features

- Establishment of a baseline voice cloning method based on the VITS model.
- Efforts to enhance voice cloning efficiency using the FreeVC model.
- Exploration into the development of a hybrid model for improved voice cloning, combining the strengths of both VITS and OpenVoice systems, although this was met with significant challenges.
